# Fake_News_Detection
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a Semantic Classification model. We will be using Word2Vec method to extract the semantic relations from the text and develop a basic understanding of how to train supervised models to categorise text based on its meaning, rather than just syntax. We will explore how this technique is used in situations where understanding textual meaning plays a critical role in making accurate and efficient decisions.
In this assignment, we will develop a Semantic Classification model that uses the Word2Vec method to detect recurring patterns and themes in news articles. Using supervised learning models, the goal is to build a system that classifies news articles as either fake or true.
